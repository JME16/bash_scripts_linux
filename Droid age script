Fun with age script


#!/bin/bash
echo "This is Droid Control, what is the name of the caller?"
read response
echo "Roger Roger $response, how old are you?"
read age
if [ "$age" -gt 40 ]
then
echo "Roger Roger, glad you called.  Good bye!"
else
echo "Roger Roger, we're blowing up your planet. Good bye."
fi
